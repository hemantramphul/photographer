## Single Page Personal Portfolio Web Application

The aim of the project is to design a single page web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. The project that has been chosen is a single page personal portfolio web application.  The website consists of five sections: Home, Login, About, Portfolio and Contact. The website will not have a registration section since normal users will not be allowed to add photos and other data to the website. Only those who will maintain the website will have the permission to add images and data to the website. Data like user login details, education, experience and photo will be stored in a SQL database. The front end of the website will communicate with the backend using AJAX.
